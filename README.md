# Evolution-of-Matter-Perturbations-

Evolves matter perturbations in a unified dark energy model. A LambdaCDM model is automatically run the first time the MGpert class is initialised (when alpha_t0 = 0, alpha_b0 = 0 and q0 = 0). Different combinations of alpha_t0, alpha_b0, and q0 can be choosen. This code also takes in observational data points and can evaluate fsigma8 from the initial power spectrum.
